## Tests
x
Testing the facial recognition software involves taking a picture with your webcam. If it recognizes a face, and does not contain it in its database currently,
the program will generate a user info page which he or she will be prompted to fill out. Upon filling out and submitting the information, the users info will be stored in the database along with all pictures taken of said person in order to more accurately identify the person in the future.
